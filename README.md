### Welcome to the repository for the final project in the automation course!

In this repository, you will find all the code and scripts that I have developed as part of my goal to showcase my
understanding of automation concepts and techniques. The final project is designed to test my skills and demonstrate my
ability to apply the knowledge I have gained throughout the course.

The code and scripts included in this repository have been thoroughly tested by me and are ready for use. However, if
you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out for assistance.

My objective with this project is to gain hands-on experience in automation and strengthen my understanding of the
course material. I hope that this repository serves as a demonstration of my competence and mastery of the subject.

Good luck and have fun!
